# Gator CLI

# Description 
Gator is a command-line interface (CLI) tool built in Go to track RSS feeds amongst different users.

## Prerequisites
- Install [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).
- Install [Go](https://go.dev/).

## Installation
To install the Gator CLI, use the `go install` command. Run the following command in your terminal: go install github.com/rjfeeney/gator@latest

    "user": "postgres",
    "password": "yourpassword",
